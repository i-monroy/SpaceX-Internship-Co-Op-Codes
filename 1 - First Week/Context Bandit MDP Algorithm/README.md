# Context Bandit MDP Algorithm

## Author
Isaac Monroy

## Project Description
Given a set of 10 slot machines, referred to as "arms", the agent aims to find the slot machine that yields the highest reward. The algorithm utilizes the Markov Decision Process and trains a Neural Network model to optimize the reward. This project can be a foundational step in understanding reinforcement learning algorithms and can be applied to various problem-solving scenarios.

## Libraries Used
- **NumPy**: Used for numerical operations.
- **torch**: Used for defining and training the neural network.
- **matplotlib**: Used for plotting the mean rewards over time.

## How to Run
1. Ensure that all required libraries are installed.
2. Run the code using a Python environment that supports the required libraries.

## Input and Output
- **Input**: No specific user input required.
- **Output**: A plot showing the mean rewards over time, helping in understanding how the algorithm improves over iterations.
