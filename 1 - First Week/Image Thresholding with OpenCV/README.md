# Image Thresholding with OpenCV

## Author
Isaac Monroy

## Project Description
A script that reads an image and applies several thresholding techniques including Binary, Binary Inversion, To Zero, To Zero Inversion, and Truncation.

### Libraries Used
- **OpenCV (cv2)**: Used for reading and applying thresholding to the image.
- **Matplotlib**: Used for plotting and displaying the processed images.
- **NumPy**: Used for numerical operations on the image.

## How to Run
1. Place your image in the specified path.
2. Run the code using a Python environment that supports the required libraries.

## Input and Output
- **Input**: Path to the grayscale image (`image_path` variable).
- **Output**: Plot showing the original and thresholded images.
