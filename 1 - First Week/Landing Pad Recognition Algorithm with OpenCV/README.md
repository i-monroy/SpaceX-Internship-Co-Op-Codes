# Landing Pad Recognition Algorithm with OpenCV

## Author
Isaac Monroy

## Project Description
Provided with a SpaceX "X" logo or SpaceX landing pad image, the algorithm recognizes all of the possible corners from the image and determines whether the image is classified as a landing pad or if no landing pad was detected.

### Libraries Used
- **OpenCV (cv2)**: Used for reading, resizing, and processing the image.
- **imutils**: Used for image resizing.
- **NumPy**: Used for numerical operations and array manipulations.

## How to Run
1. Specify the image path for the desired image for processing.
2. Run the code using a Python environment that supports the required libraries.

## Input and Output
- **Input**: Path to the landing pad image (`img_path` variable).
- **Output**: Display of original, resized, edged, and result in images, along with classification as a landing pad or not.
