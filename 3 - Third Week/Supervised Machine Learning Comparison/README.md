# Supervised Machine Learning Comparison

## Author
Isaac Monroy

## Project Description
This project illustrates the differences between various supervised machine learning models. It includes interactive plots for visualizing how models such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks behave with different parameters, datasets, and visualization techniques.

## Libraries Used
- **numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **matplotlib, mpl_toolkits**: For plotting and 3D visualization.
- **mglearn**: For extended visualization of decision boundaries.
- **ipywidgets**: For creating interactive widgets.
- **sklearn**: For implementing various machine learning models and datasets.

## How to Run
1. Ensure all required libraries are installed.
2. Load the code into a Jupyter Notebook environment.
3. Execute the cells with different interactive parameters to visualize model behavior.

## Input and Output
- **Input**: Various datasets including the breast cancer dataset, Gaussian blobs, and the two moons dataset.
- **Output**: Visualizations showing model behavior, decision boundaries, and feature importance across different models.
