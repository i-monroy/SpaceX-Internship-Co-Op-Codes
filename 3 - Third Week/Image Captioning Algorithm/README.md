# Image Captioning Algorithm

## Author
Isaac Monroy

## Project Description
This project involves using a neural network model to automatically caption images from the COCO dataset, leveraging CNN and Transformer architecture.

## Libraries Used
- **TensorFlow**: For building and training the neural network model.
- **Pandas**: To handle data manipulation.
- **Numpy**: Used for numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: To visualize images and training plots.
- **Requests**: For fetching data from the internet.
- **PIL**: To process images.
- **tqdm**: To display progress bars.
- **os, json, re, time, collections, random, pickle**: Various utility libraries for file handling, regular expressions, timing, data structures, randomness, and serialization.

## How to Run
1. Install the required libraries.
2. Ensure that you have the dataset 
3. Adjust global variables and parameters if needed.
4. Run the script to generate captions for your images.

## Input and Output
- **Input**: Images from the COCO dataset or any compatible image.
- **Output**: A textual caption describing the content of the image.
